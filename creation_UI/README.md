# Chronic Pain UI Application

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a Chronic Pain UI application developed with React. The application is designed to assist 
individuals in visualizing and managing chronic pain through interactive image handling. Users can upload their pain-related images 
or create new ones based on descriptive prompts, enhancing their ability to communicate and reflect on their pain with healthcare providers
or for personal insight.

## Features

### Image Upload and Creation
The application allows users to upload images depicting their experiences with chronic pain. Additionally, users can create images using a series of prompts that guide them to visualize their pain. This feature is aimed at providing users with the means to express aspects of their pain that may be difficult to articulate verbally.

### Image Improvement and Interaction
Once images are uploaded or created, users can modify these images to better reflect their current pain experience. Tools are provided within the UI to enhance and edit images according to user needs. This interactive process is central to the application, offering a user-friendly experience in managing the depiction of their pain.

### Navigation Controls
Users can navigate through the application easily. If a user is not satisfied with an edit, they can utilize the 'Go Back' feature to return to the previous page and undo changes. Conversely, if they are satisfied with the modifications, they can proceed to the next page where the updated image will be displayed. This functionality ensures that users maintain control over their visual expressions and can iterate on them until they are content with the results.

### Progress so far
Right now the functionalities are yet to be added, but the basic functions are implemented. For timing reasons, parts of the functionalities have been commented out.
