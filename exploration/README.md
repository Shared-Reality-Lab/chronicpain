# Chronic Pain Related Artwork Exploration in VR
 The scope of this project was to design and develop a VR art therapy environment which can be used in future research. For future research continuing the progress made this semester, there are several resources available.

 ## Research Paper
 A detailed research paper was written to communicate the work done during the W24 semester, as well as to specify all the information needed to continue this research. The research paper can be found at the following link: https://github.com/lilygostovic/Chronic-Pain-Exploratory-Museum/blob/main/Report/Report.pdf.

 ## Design Prototype
 A detailed design document was created using Figma. This file is publically available for viewing and further development at the following url: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1360640316462533039/exploratory-chornic-pain-museum-prototype.

 At the above link, a preview of the file can be viewed without creating a Figma account. However, to open the file in Figma, an account must be created. Once an account is created, users can continue to the file and edit freely without changing the original file to make any modifications and future iterations needed.

 ## VR Environment
 A VR environment was developed as a starting point for future research to be built off of. This project can be found at: https://github.com/lilygostovic/Chronic-Pain-Exploratory-Museum. It can also be cloned directly using the following command: 
 
 `git clone https://github.com/lilygostovic/Chronic-Pain-Exploratory-Museum.git`

 Once a copy of the repo has been copied to your local machine, it can be opened in the Unity Hub by clicking "Add" and opening the cloned folder. 

 The README.md file in the aforementioned GitHub repo has detailed instructions on how to build the Unity environment to the Meta Quest 2.
